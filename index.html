<h1> Portfolio	</h1>
<p>	
As an accomplished educator, I participated in some of the most progressive education reforms in the United States. Our nation continues to see unprecedented numbers of young people dropping out of school each year who are not prepared to compete and take their rightful place in this multi-ethnic global economy. After several years of intensive research, I plan to introduce recommendations that will move our school systems fifty years ahead of most top academically nations.
